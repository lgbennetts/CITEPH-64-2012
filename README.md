CITEPH Project Wave propagation in ice covered seas: compare model predictions with data from wavetank experiments conducted at Oceanide, La Seyne, France in July 2013

Branch "PTRSA_2015" is fixed at the version of the code used for the paper:
Bennetts, L.G. and Williams, T.D., 2015, January. Water wave transmission by an array of floating discs. In Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences (Vol. 471, No. 2173, p. 20140698). The Royal Society.

To start: 

cd Main_Files;
CreatePaths_Mac # to create the necessary paths

then run:

Main_RAO           # to perform comparisons for a single disk
Main_Trans         # to perform comparisons of transmission by multiple disks
Main_CollisionData # to analyse collision data

see the help at the beginning at each of these main functions
