	17 Sep 2002
	Version 1.1 public release

Version 1.1.1
	7 Oct 2002
	Correction of minor mistake in Infospec function for energy based significant wave height calculation.

Version 1.1.2
	9 Oct 2002
	Correction of spectral density scaling which gave incorrect significant wave height calculation. Fix of bug in transfer functions for subsurface datatypes ('velx','vely','velz','pres') where hyperbolic functions "blew up" in large depths and gave a NaN transfer value.

Version 1.2
	29 Aug 2006
	Change to license - removal of restrictions, update to standard GNU public license.

Version 1.3
	31 Jan 2008
	Improved spectral matrix interpolation
	Addition of new function diwasp_csd that removes need for Mathworks signal processing toolbox.
	Addition of variable units for spectral matrix frequency and direction
	Changes to plotspec function for nautical directions

Version 1.3.1
	26 Feb 2008
	Bugfix in diwasp_csd to correctly return cross power spectral density

Version 1.4
	13 Feb 2012
	Some new transfer functions
	Bug fix to makespec.m function + change wave height parameter to Hsig for consistency with infospec
